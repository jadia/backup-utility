# --- Known Duplicates ---
# You can feed the output of the Duplicate Finder back into the auditor
# to ignore files you already know are duplicates.
# Format: List of JSON objects with a "hash" and "files" array.

# --- Auditor Configuration ---
# Note: The auditor's database name, directory exclusions, and critical 
# hashing extension filters have been decoupled and moved to:
# `auditor_config.json` for safer and cleaner Python parsing.
